Summer morning sheds sweet dew  
cloudy window glass  
birds are singing in the trees  
morning music class  
<!--more-->

Summer noon scorch marks the skies  
reflection on grass  
butterflies in their crazy moves  
dancing upon flowers  

Summer eve she pains the skies  
hiding dirty scars  
a tired sun at last leaves the scene  
ushering shiny stars
