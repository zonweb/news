## Problem:

You are using Jekyll to build your website, and you are getting a few warnings like these when you run the command,
```text
jekyll serve
```
```text

```
Your error output will most likely be a bit different from the above example but the important error parts to note down are,
```text
warning: already initialized constant...
warning: previous definition was here...
```
Your site builds and deploys correctly despite these errors but you want to get rid of these errors, don't you? yes, you do.

## Solution:

First remove the file <inline-code>Gemfile.lock</inline-code> from the root of your site.  
Next run this command in terminal from the root of your site,
```text
bundle update
```
This should fix those bugging errors.  
Whenever in the future you want to build your site and you have a <inline-code>Gemfile</inline-code> in your site's root directory you always must build your site with this command,
```text
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Cheers!!!
