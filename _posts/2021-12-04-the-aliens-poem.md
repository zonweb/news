you may not believe it  
but there are people  
who go through life with  
very little  
friction or  
distress.  
<!--more-->
they dress well, eat  
well, sleep well.  
they are contented with  
their family  
life.  
they have moments of  
grief but all in  
all they are undisturbed  
and often feel  
very good.  
and when they die  
it is an easy  
death, usually in their  
sleep.  

you may not believe  
it  
but such people do  
exist.  

but I am not one of  
them. oh no, I am not one  
of them,  
I am not even near  
to being  
one of  
them  
but they are  
there  

and I am  
here.  

~ A poem by Henry Charles Bukowski
