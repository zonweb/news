I came across an article by [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/){:target="_blank"} on his blog where he pondered on about using a better term than "Google it" when referring to a web search to be performed on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/){:target="_blank"}. Here are a few alternatives Kev came up with and quickly discarded. I'm quoting the following straight from his [blog post](https://kevq.uk/is-there-a-better-term-than-google-it/){:target="_blank"},  
> I could say “DuckDuckGo it" but most people would have no idea what I’m talking about, plus it doesn’t role off the tongue very nicely. Using “search for it" is non-contextual. Search for it where? In the drawer? Under the bed? What does “search for it" mean?  

In the end Kev settled on using "look it up". I found that a bit intriguing since the same argument Kev used against "search for it" earlier can be applied here too,  
> look it up where? In the drawer? Under the bed? What does “look it up" mean?  

This got me pondering too. After a bit of reading on the help pages of DuckDuckGo I found the holy grail. And what's the magic term?  
Well, It's simple, memorable and obvious,  
[Duck it!](https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/name/){:target="_blank"}  
I shouldn't have wasted my time reading through help pages though as a simple mouse hover over the Duck's logo reveals the should-have-been-obvious answer.  

Holy duck!
