### A Thoughtful Approach to Wealth

In a recent interview with the *Daily Mail*, Rain expressed her hopes for continued success, stating, “All I can hope for is at least the same amount that I made the first year.” Rather than splurging on flashy cars or designer clothes, this devout Christian is channeling her earnings into **real estate investments**.

One of her first major purchases? A **20-acre property** that she plans to share with her family as a surprise Christmas gift. “I’m really excited about it. They don’t know that, so that’s gonna be part of their Christmas presents. They’re gonna literally die,” she exclaimed.

Looking ahead to 2025, Rain has big plans, including the purchase of a **Florida mansion** dubbed the "Bop House." This space will serve as a creative hub for her and her influencer friends to collaborate and produce content. “It’s just like a little girl group that we’re all doing, and we just want to uplift each other and help each other grow on TikTok,” she shared.

### Navigating Fame and Privacy

However, fame comes with its challenges. Rain has expressed concerns about her safety, noting that being recognized in public can be overwhelming. “I was actually out last night with my family having dinner at a restaurant and I got recognized there,” she revealed. “I am always looking over my shoulder, but I surround myself with a really good group of people.”
