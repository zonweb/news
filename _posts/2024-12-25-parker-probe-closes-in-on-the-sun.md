NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has made an incredible leap in space exploration, coming within just 3.86 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the Sun’s surface on Christmas Eve — setting a new record. This awe-inspiring moment marks humanity’s closest-ever approach to a star and the fastest speed ever achieved by a man-made object. You can follow Parker’s groundbreaking journey on NASA’s Eyes On The Solar System page.

### A Monumental Milestone

On Tuesday, December 24, at 11:53 UTC (6:53 a.m. EST), Parker Solar Probe flew closer to the Sun than any human-made spacecraft in history, reaching a distance of just 3.86 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) — approximately 96% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and even closer than Mercury’s orbit.

This historic flyby was Parker’s 22nd close approach to the Sun, marking a defining moment for humankind. As NASA’s fastest-ever spacecraft, Parker reached speeds of up to 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) during this record-breaking flyby, breaking its own speed record and earning a place in space exploration history.

### A Journey Through the Sun's Wrath

NASA describes the Parker mission as entering a “hyper-close regime,” where the spacecraft will pass through plasma plumes still connected to the Sun. At this close range, Parker will even dive through solar eruptions, like a surfer riding the crash of a wave.

The heat at this proximity to the Sun is almost incomprehensible — 500 times hotter than the hottest summer day on Earth. Yet, Parker continues to break records, holding up under extreme conditions that no other spacecraft has encountered.

### A Moment That Echoes the Moon Landing

Dr. Nour Raouafi, the project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, compares the significance of this achievement to the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. “This is the moment we’ve been waiting for for nearly 60 years,” he said during a media roundtable on December 10. “In 1969, we landed humans on the moon. On Christmas Eve, we embraced our star.”

### What's Next for Parker?

Parker’s journey isn’t over yet. The spacecraft will complete two more close passes of the Sun in 2025, with planned flybys on March 22 and June 19. As it ventures deeper into the solar system, it will continue to send back data, advancing our understanding of the Sun and its influence on the entire solar system.

For now, mission operators at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory are waiting to re-establish contact with Parker on December 27, 2024, after a three-day communication blackout. This beacon signal will confirm the spacecraft’s survival after the most daring leg of its journey.

Clear skies and wide eyes as we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration. The Sun has never been so close, and neither has humanity.
