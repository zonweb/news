**Japan’s Bold Energy Vision: Nuclear Power and Renewables in the Race for a Greener Future**

TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s government has unveiled an ambitious new energy policy aimed at balancing the country’s growing electricity demand with its decarbonization goals. This plan seeks to significantly boost nuclear power use while expanding renewable energy sources, marking a significant shift in Japan's post-Fukushima energy landscape.

A panel of 16 experts, largely in favor of nuclear energy, reviewed the draft proposal on Wednesday, which calls for maximizing the use of nuclear power and bolstering renewables to meet future energy needs. The government aims to have renewables supply up to 50% of the nation’s electricity by 2040, while increasing nuclear energy’s share to 20%, a notable rise from its current level of 8.5%. Coal power, which currently dominates the country’s energy mix, is expected to drop significantly, from nearly 70% in recent years to 30-40% by 2040.

This new energy blueprint is set to replace Japan’s current energy policy, which was established in 2021. It comes at a time when demand for low-carbon energy is surging, driven by the expanding need for power from AI data centers and semiconductor factories across the country.

### The Return of Nuclear Power: A Controversial Path

The draft plan represents a bold reversal of Japan's post-Fukushima policy, which sought to phase out nuclear energy after the catastrophic 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The nuclear meltdown led to widespread displacement and a lingering distrust of nuclear power. However, with growing pressure to meet climate goals and the increasing demand for energy, the government is now advocating for nuclear energy to play a more significant role in the country’s energy future.

Japan’s Industry Minister, Yoji Muto, emphasized the importance of diversifying the country's energy sources to ensure energy security. “It’s time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both,” he stated during the panel meeting. He also reiterated that securing decarbonized energy is crucial for Japan's future growth.

The country has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with an interim goal of reducing emissions by 73% by 2040 compared to 2013 levels. The draft plan calls for a major expansion of renewable energy, which is expected to contribute 40-50% of Japan's electricity by 2040, up from just 22.9% last year.

### The Challenges Ahead: Feasibility and Public Opinion

While the plan sets ambitious targets, it faces significant challenges. Experts have pointed out that the feasibility of meeting the 20% nuclear energy target by 2040 is uncertain. For Japan to achieve this goal, all 33 of its operational nuclear reactors must be restarted, but only 14 are currently online following the Fukushima disaster. The lengthy safety checks required by Japan’s nuclear regulatory authorities further complicate the timeline.

Some experts have also raised concerns that the plan does not include clear roadmaps for the phaseout of fossil fuels or a robust outlook for the future of renewables. Despite these challenges, Japan remains committed to developing advanced nuclear reactors and improving its spent fuel reprocessing program in an effort to complete the nuclear fuel cycle.

### A Green Energy Future?

Japan’s new energy plan is a complex balancing act, seeking to blend nuclear power and renewable energy sources while addressing both energy demand and environmental concerns. As the country heads toward 2040, it remains to be seen whether this vision can be fully realized amid growing skepticism, public opposition to nuclear energy, and the technical hurdles associated with renewable energy development.

With global attention on Japan's energy transition, the world is watching closely to see if the nation can overcome its challenges and set a new standard for clean energy innovation.
