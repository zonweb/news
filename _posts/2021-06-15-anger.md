Don’t tell me that you understand,  
don’t tell me that you know.  
Don’t tell me that I will survive,  
how I will surely grow.  
<!--more-->

Don’t tell me this is just a test,  
that I am truly blessed,  
that I am chosen for this task,  
apart from all the rest.  

Don’t come at me with answers  
that can only come from me,  
don’t tell me how my grief will pass,  
that I will soon be free.  

Don’t stand in pious judgment  
of the bonds I must untie,  
don’t tell me how to suffer,  
and don’t tell me how to cry.  

My life is filled with selfishness,  
my pain is all I see,  
but I need you, I need your love,  
unconditionally.  

Accept me in my ups and downs,  
I need someone to share,  
just hold my hand and let me cry,  
and say, “My friend, I care.”  

~ A poem by Joanetta Hendel
