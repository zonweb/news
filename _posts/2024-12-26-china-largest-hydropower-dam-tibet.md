In a groundbreaking move, China has approved the construction of what will become the world’s largest hydropower dam, set to be built on the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet. This ambitious project, once completed, could transform the energy landscape of China while having far-reaching environmental and geopolitical implications for neighboring countries like India and Bangladesh.

The dam, located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, is expected to generate an astonishing 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This is more than three times the current output of the Three Gorges Dam, which, at 88.2 billion kWh, is the world’s largest operational hydropower plant.

This colossal undertaking is not only a major step toward China’s carbon peaking and neutrality goals, but it is also poised to drive job creation, boost local industries, and stimulate economic growth in Tibet. As reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency, the project will play a pivotal role in enhancing China’s renewable energy capacity.

One of the most remarkable features of the Yarlung Zangbo River is a section that drops 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) within a 50 km (31 miles) span. This dramatic elevation change offers immense hydropower potential, but also presents unique engineering challenges that will test the limits of modern construction techniques.

The estimated cost of the dam’s construction, including engineering expenses, is expected to surpass that of the Three Gorges Dam, which was completed at a cost of 254.2 billion yuan ($34.83 billion). The Three Gorges project also required the resettlement of 1.4 million people, a factor that added to its overall expense.

While details regarding the displacement of people and potential ecological impacts from the Tibet project remain unclear, Chinese officials argue that hydropower development in Tibet, which houses more than a third of the country’s hydroelectric power potential, will have minimal environmental effects. However, concerns persist from India and Bangladesh about how the dam could alter river flow and disrupt local ecosystems.

The Yarlung Zangbo River, which transforms into the Brahmaputra as it flows southward through India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states, and eventually into Bangladesh, is a critical water source for millions of people. Both India and Bangladesh have raised alarms that the dam may significantly affect water supplies and the region's biodiversity.

China has already begun hydropower operations along the upper stretches of the Yarlung Zangbo and is planning additional projects upstream, which could further complicate the downstream flow of the river.

As China forges ahead with this ambitious energy project, the impact on regional geopolitics and the environment remains a subject of intense scrutiny, with neighboring countries closely monitoring developments.
