## Valve's Profit Per Employee: A David Among Goliaths in Tech

### The Big Picture

Valve Corporation stands as a titan in the PC gaming landscape, not just for its innovative contributions but also for its distinctive operational model. Unlike its competitors, Valve operates with a surprisingly small workforce, yet its financial impact is monumental. Recent revelations from an ongoing lawsuit against the company shed light on how Valve's profitability per employee starkly contrasts with that of the world's largest tech firms.

A Valve employee recently shared insights with **PC Gamer**, indicating that the company's revenue per employee surpasses that of several industry behemoths. Although the data is somewhat dated and doesn't fully capture recent shifts in the tech sector, Valve's position in this metric remains impressive.

While specific figures for Valve's per-hour and per-employee net income are still under wraps, a 2018 chart illustrates that Valve's earnings per employee outstrip those of major players like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon.

### A Closer Look at the Numbers

Facebook leads the pack with a staggering **$780,400** per employee (or **$89** per hour), largely due to its lean workforce of just under 70,000 employees. In contrast, tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, with workforces more than double that size, lag behind. Amazon, with over **1.5 million** employees, reports a mere **$15,892** per employee, translating to just **$1.81** per hour.

Documents from a 2021 antitrust lawsuit filed by Wolfire Games revealed that Valve employed only **336** individuals at that timeâ€”fewer than the team behind **Baldur's Gate 3**. Despite this small team, Valve manages **Steam**, which boasts nearly **40 million** daily users and commands a significant share of the PC game sales market. Wolfire pointed to this disparity as evidence that Steam's **30%** revenue cut on most titles is unwarranted.

### The Impact of the Steam Deck

It's important to note that the available data does not account for the launch of the **Steam Deck** in 2022. While it's uncertain how much Valve expanded its workforce for this handheld gaming device, it's unlikely that the company scaled up to the extent of other tech giants.

Given the current data, Valve would likely maintain its top position in terms of per-employee income. However, recent trends, including widespread layoffs and the burgeoning AI sector, could alter the rankings for other companies. It will be fascinating to see if **Nvidia** has entered the fray, as its profits have soared amid the AI boom, recently earning it a spot in the **$3 trillion club**.
