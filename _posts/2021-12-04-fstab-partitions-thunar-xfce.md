## Problem:

You want to mount certain partitions at custom mount points with specific file system options so you define all that in <code>/etc/fstab</code> file but after doing so you discover that Thunar file manager of XFCE doesn't show those partitions! What's wrong? How to make Thunar display those partitions?

## Solution:

Well, as it turns out the solution to this problem is really simple. All you need to do is add <code>comment=x-gvfs-show</code> option to your partition entries in <code>/etc/fstab</code> file. For example let's say you added an fstab entry for your partition <code>sda1</code> like this,  
```bash
/dev/sda1	/mnt/sda1	ext4	defaults,noauto,noatime	0	0
``` 
And it didn't show up in Thunar. All you need to do now is add <code>comment=x-gvfs-show</code> option to this entry like this,  
```bash
/dev/sda1	/mnt/sda1	ext4	defaults,noauto,noatime,comment=x-gvfs-show	0	0
```
Save the file once you are done editing and reboot your computer. Rebooting is not strictly necessary as a log-out and log-back-in routine is good enough for most cases. Start Thunar and it'll definitely show those partitions entries now. If it is still not showing those entries, then I'm afraid you'll have to wield your hammer!
