A devastating crash in western Kazakhstan on Wednesday involving an Azerbaijani airliner has resulted in the loss of 38 lives, but remarkably, 29 people survived. The crash occurred near the city of Aktau, where the plane, an Embraer 190 aircraft, was attempting an emergency landing.

Kazakh officials reported the crash, which involved 67 people on board, including 62 passengers and five crew members. Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbaev shared the grim details during a meeting with Azerbaijani officials, according to Russian news agency Interfax.

Azerbaijan Airlines confirmed that both pilots were among those killed. The cause of the crash is under investigation, with initial reports pointing to a bird strike that forced the pilots to divert to Aktau. This diversion came after an emergency situation unfolded in the air, leading to the catastrophic outcome.

Initially, Kazakhstan's Emergency Ministry reported that only 25 survived, but as search and rescue teams continued their work, the number of survivors grew, eventually reaching 29. While Azerbaijan’s Prosecutor General's Office initially reported 32 survivors, the final number is still subject to confirmation.

Among the passengers, 42 were Azerbaijani citizens, 16 were Russian nationals, six were Kazakhstani, and three were from Kyrgyzstan. The flight was originally headed from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, but was rerouted due to poor visibility in Grozny caused by fog.

The plane’s descent before impact was captured in mobile phone footage, which showed a steep plunge followed by a fiery explosion. Emergency responders were able to extinguish the flames quickly. Further footage showed the fuselage separated from the wings, with the wreckage lying scattered on the ground, and survivors were seen assisting fellow passengers.

Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24 indicated significant altitude fluctuations and a possible "figure-eight" maneuver just before the crash. The aircraft also experienced "strong GPS jamming," which may have affected its navigation data, a tactic previously linked to regional disruptions, including those from Russian sources.

The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and Azerbaijan Airlines has pledged to keep the public informed. As of the latest update, the airline has changed its social media banners to solid black in mourning.

This tragic incident highlights the unpredictable and fragile nature of air travel, where moments of disaster can coexist with remarkable stories of survival.
