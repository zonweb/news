Did you hear or read about wars in Yemen & Tigray? Did the international-national media run headlines on humanitarian tragedies in Yemen & Tigray? Did the celebrities flood Twitter & Instagram with their expressions of shock, anger, grief over the situation & solidarity with the people of Yemen & Tigray? Did the leaders of the United States & European Union unleash a series of sanctions against Saudi Arabian, Emirati & Ethiopian leaderships? Did global corporations close their operations & pull out of Saudi Arabia, UAE & Ethiopia?  

The uncomfortable yet inevitable answer is, NO!  

But, why?  

Something has to be special about Ukraine and Ukrainian people. What could it be?  

I thought about this question and pondered on it for quite a while, but failed to find a meaningful answer or to reach a conclusion. Then, on a whim, I searched DuckDuckGo with the following search terms,  

Ukrainian people, Yemeni people, Tigrayan people  

And, I think I have reached a conclusion that is both disturbing & obvious. I won't burden you with my conclusion, but I learned following during my DuckDuckGo search,  

Ukrainian are Caucasian people with white skin, Yemeni are Arab people with brown skin and Tigrayan are Ethiopian people with black skin.
