Hirokazu Yokohara, a talented 3D artist with vast experience across multiple 3D software, has made a fascinating discovery: the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has released a comprehensive 3D dataset capturing the city's topography, architecture, and urban infrastructure. This invaluable dataset is available for download and is an exciting opportunity for 3D artists, developers, and researchers to create highly detailed and realistic models of the bustling metropolis.

This point-cloud file, which Hirokazu Yokohara reveals covers the entirety of Tokyo, goes beyond just representing one neighborhood like Shinjuku. Artists can leverage the data to build intricate virtual landscapes and even overlay additional data layers, such as real-time bus tracking or other dynamic elements, to enhance the models.
