## Chaos in MAGA: Laura Loomer Declares War on Elon Musk

### The Clash of Titans

![Chaos in MAGA: Laura Loomer Declares War on Elon Musk](https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/1WZPlHGP_/0x0/laura-loomer-war-elon-musk-stage-5-clinger-donald-trump-at-mar-a-lago-1735314719648.jpg "Chaos in MAGA: Laura Loomer Declares War on Elon Musk")

In a surprising turn of events, **Elon Musk** has found himself at odds with one of **Donald Trump**'s most fervent supporters, right-wing influencer **Laura Loomer**. The conflict erupted over Musk's advocacy for increased immigration in the science and technology sectors, a stance that has ruffled feathers within the MAGA community.

On Thursday, Loomer unleashed a barrage of criticism on **X** (formerly Twitter), targeting Musk and his perceived influence over Trump. She derided Musk's initiative, the “**Department of Government Efficiency**,” which he is developing alongside **Vivek Ramaswamy**, labeling it a “**vanity project**.” Loomer further accused Musk of using this initiative as a cover for the “**pet projects of tech bro billionaires**,” predicting an imminent fallout between Musk and Trump.

### Musk Strikes Back

In response to Loomer's tirade, Musk dismissed her as a “**troll**” and suggested that she should be ignored. However, Loomer doubled down, branding the tech mogul a “**pawn of China**” and hurling a series of homophobic and racist insults. She accused Musk of having “**bought his way into MAGA**,” questioning his loyalty to the movement.

“Remember when you voted for Biden and propped up @GovRonDeSantis, claiming Trump was too old? We all know you only donated your money to influence immigration policy and protect your buddy Xi Jinping,” Loomer posted. In another fiery message, she labeled Musk “**a total f****ing drag on the Trump transition**,” suggesting he was overstaying his welcome at **Mar-a-Lago** in a bid to become Trump’s “**side piece**.”

### Loomer's Agenda

Loomer, infamous for her Islamophobia, racism, and conspiracy theories, appears to be opposing Musk for reasons deeply rooted in her anti-immigration stance. Her rhetoric is laced with racism, as she frequently invokes China and targets individuals from India in her attacks.

In a related development, Musk's ally, **Vivek Ramaswamy**, also faced backlash from MAGA supporters for his own immigration views. His recent comments about perceived shortcomings in American culture ignited racist sentiments from the far right, further complicating Musk and Ramaswamy's standing within Trump’s inner circle.

As tensions rise, it seems that both Musk and Ramaswamy may be wearing out their welcome in Trumpworld, potentially risking the ire of the former president himself.
