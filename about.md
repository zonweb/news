Hi, I'm hakerdefo. Welcome to my hyding place on the wild web, powered by Jekyll.  
Here you will find me musing about anything and everything that piqued my interest.  
<p></p>
This blog is themed using a wonderful Jekyll template called [Forever Jekyll](https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll).  
<p></p>
Wanna know something more about me? Well, I'm a just another guy on the vast ocean of the Internet. I'm not even a speck of dust in the grand scheme of the universe. I'm not that important and interesting in short, but since you are curious here are a few things about me, just for you.  
- I love listening to all sorts of music.  
- I used to read a truck load of books, but haven't been able to read as many books as I'd have liked to in the recent past.  
- I like to watch films, but don't usually get to watch that many for a variety of reasons.  
- I write songs, poems and short stories when I'm either super high or super low.  
- I like to travel to isolated places that are closer to nature and farther from the crowd.  
- I like to take photographs.  
- I exclusively use GNU/Linux based operating systems. I'm currently running ALT Sisyphus, Debian Sid, Debian stable, Manjaro, NuTyX, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Rosa, Ubuntu LTS and Zenwalk.  
- Openbox is my WM/DE of choice.  
- I prefer Sakura as terminal emulator.  
- GNU nano and Mousepad are my preferred text-editors.  
- Firefox is my browser of choice.  
- I use Mutt and SeaMonkey to manage my emails.  
- cmus and MOC are my preferred audio players.  
- mpv is what I use to watch videos.  
- I use viewnior, mtPaint and ImageMagick to work with photographs and images.  
- I love messing around with code. I'm not a programmer by any means but hack, I like to hack.  
- And last but not the least, I use Git for managing my code.
